<b>Task 1: Data Cleaning</b><br>

<b>1.</b> Check for duplicates in the dataset and remove them.<br>
<b>2.</b> Standardize the date values to the format YYYY-MM-DD and extract the month name and day type from them.<br>
<b>3.</b> Remove any extra characters, such as special characters, from the employee ID values. Some IDs may contain a '@' character at the end, which can be cleaned and brought to a common format.<br>
<b>4.</b> Standardize the capitalization of names. Convert all names to title case, which means capitalizing the first letter of each word.<br>
Map the corresponding values in the status column with the given abbreviations:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Work From Office → WFO</li>
  <li>Work From Home → WFH</li>
  <li>Birthday Leave → BL</li>
  <li>Menstrual Leave → ML</li>

</ul>
<b>Task 2: Ad Hoc aka Analysis</b><br><br>
<b>1.</b> What is the total count of distinct employee names within the dataset?<br>
<b>2.</b> Calculate the work-from-home (WFH %) percentage in the month of May.<br>
<b>3.</b> Determine which day of the week had the highest attendance percentage in the month of June.<br>
<b>4.</b> Find out the number of employees who had a WFH percentage greater than 10% in the month of April.<br><br>
You are free to use any tool of your preference, such as Pandas, Excel, PowerBI, etc., to complete this task.<br>

If you have any follow-up questions on the task, you can ask your seniors.<br>

But they are busy, try to solve it on your own as much as possible.<br>

Good luck with your task!<br>

<h3>Data Normalization</h3>
<b>Arindam Das,</b><br><br>

Well done with the previous task. I have a new one for you.

One of our client projects requires minor support. The dataset is currently in a de-normalized form, and we need your help to transform it into a normalized form.

Your task will involve creating proper fact and dimension tables based on the dataset, which can be found in the "fact_order_lines.csv" file.

Here are a few screenshots of the dataset to give you a better idea of what it looks like and how the final output should be presented:

<b>Input Data</b><br>

<h1>WEEK 2:</h1>
<h2>E-mail #1: Create This Variance Report</h2>
<h3>Variance Analysis</h3>
<b>Arindam Das,</b><br><br>

Here is the detailed explanation of the task.<br>
<p align="justify">You need to conduct variance analysis to compare benchmark data (benchmarks.csv) with their current data (fact_orders.csv). The goal of this analysis is to identify and quantify the differences or variations between the two datasets. Specifically, you will be comparing the order quantity and delivery quantity from the fact_orders.csv file with the benchmark data provided in the benchmarks.csv file.</p>
<b>Datasets:</b><br>
You will be provided with three datasets for this analysis:
<ul>
<li> fact_orders.csv: Contains columns like order_id, order_placement_date, mmm_yy, customer_id, product_name, order_qty, and delivery_qty.</li>
<li> dim_customers.csv: Contains columns like customer_id, customer_name, and city.</li>
<li> benchmarks.csv: Contains columns like mmm_yy, customer_id, customer_name, city, total_order_quantity, and total_delivery_quantity.</li> 
</ul>
<b>Workflow:</b><br>
Here is a brief overview of the workflow for the task:

<b>1.</b> Review the benchmark data and the current data (fact_orders.csv).<br>
<b>2.</b> Metrics to compare between two files: Order quantity and Delivery quantity.<br>
<b>3.</b> Calculate the variance (absolute value) between the benchmark data and the current data for the identified metrics.<br>
<b>4.</b> Calculate the variance (in percentage) between the benchmark data and the current data for the identified metrics.<br>
<b>5.</b> Provide a complete report of the difference in numbers between the benchmark data and the main data.<br><br>
Please ensure that you thoroughly analyze the datasets and provide a comprehensive report of the differences in the order quantity and delivered quantity between the benchmark data and the main data.<br>

Attaching screenshots from a dummy report I created, which will give you a better idea of what it looks like and how the final output should be presented:<br><br>

## E-mail #1: Feature List
<p align="justify">The task is to create a feature list based on the email provided below from the client and a sample feature list.The email contains project requirements which need to be analyzed and included in the feature list. The sample feature list available in the download section serves as a reference for the created feature list.The created feature list must capture all the mentioned features and include relevant details.</p>

## PILOT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Dear Hemanand,<br><br>
I hope this email finds you well. I’m summarizing the requirements for the pilot project as discussed in the last call.<br><br>
To begin, we would like to focus on understanding the number of customers we have and the total revenue we are generating. It would also be beneficial to track the daily revenue growth rate and daily customer growth rate to monitor our progress.<br><br>
Monitoring changes in policies on a month-over-month basis is also important to identify trends and areas for improvement. It would be helpful to segment our customer base by age group and analyze revenue and customer numbers by city and age group.<br><br>
To analyze trends in customer and revenue growth over time, it would be great to create a switch between revenue trend graphs and customer trend graphs. Additionally, using filters to analyze sales mode, age group, city, month, and policy ID would make the analysis more efficient.<br><br>
It would be valuable to have a separate page for sales mode analysis to better understand our customer demographics. We can calculate total customers and total revenue split percentages by sales mode and analyze the trend of sales mode over the month.<br><br>
Having a separate page for age group analysis would also be helpful to understand the impact of age groups on our business. We can analyze age group data to understand expected settlement, sales mode, and policy preference, which will help us make informed business decisions.<br><br>
We believe that this pilot project will help us gain valuable insights and build confidence in our collaboration. I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.<br><br>
I’m also attaching the data & metadata for your reference.

Best regards,

Hello Mathew,

Sharing the latest update on the pilot dashboard mockup as discussed.

I have completed the initial mockup covering the core requirements of the pilot project, structured into three sections:

Executive Overview – Overall customer and revenue KPIs with trend analysis to provide a quick business snapshot.

Sales Mode Analysis – Channel-wise customer and revenue contribution, sales mode trends, and age group vs sales mode performance to understand distribution and efficiency.

Age Group Analysis – Customer and revenue distribution by age group along with expected settlement and preference analysis to support demographic-level insights.

The mockup focuses on clear segmentation, consistent KPIs, and intuitive visual flow, keeping the pilot scope in mind. This is a high-level structure intended to validate alignment on metrics and layout before proceeding with detailed dashboard development.

Please review the attached mockup and let me know if there are any changes or additional insights you would like to incorporate before moving to the next phase.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards, Arindam

I saw the response from Mathew and you did a good job there. As a next step, you will be creating a dashboard, and I want to give you some quick tips.

Ensure that the dashboard you are creating meets Mathew’s requirements.<br>
Create a DAX metrics list so that you have clarity before building the dashboard.<br>
Create documentation for Mathew so that they won’t have issues in understanding the dashboard.<br>
I have attached a sample DAX metrics list and sample documentation from previous projects that should help guide you in the right direction. Study these resources and use them as a reference throughout your work.<br>
